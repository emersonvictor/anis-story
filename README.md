# Ani's Story
## A game that will make you reflect!

There are millions of people around the world like Ani and our game tells their stories... Ani’s story. Stories of people who needs to leave the bed, fight their fears and the loneliness. All these things only to do daily stuff like answer their phone, play their guitar or even open their bedroom’s door. 

Ani has depression and everything they need to do demand a lot of effort. During the game, Ani find some masks which represents feelings like loneliness, anxiety, fear and anguish.

We want to bring a perspective of depression through metaphors of real and fantastic elements. Our game will bring to you an adventure with highs and lows, just like life. But overall will make you think...

### That’s Ani’s story!
